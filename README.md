  Heart Stroke Prediction System ❤️
This project predicts the likelihood of a heart stroke based on patient health data using Machine Learning. It includes:

A trained ML model (e.g., Random Forest)
A Streamlit web app for user-friendly predictions
Data preprocessing and feature engineering pipelines

✅ Input Parameters:

Age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, BMI, glucose levels, smoking status
Other clinical biomarkers (e.g., hypertension, heart disease history)

✅ Predictions:
Probability score (0-100%) of stroke risk
Classification (High Risk / Low Risk)

✅ User Interface:
Interactive sliders/form inputs
Visualization (risk score meter, feature importance)
Responsive design (mobile & desktop)

✅ Tech Stack:
ML: Scikit-learn 
Frontend: Streamlit
